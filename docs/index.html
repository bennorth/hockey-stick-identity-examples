<h1 class="title">Two cases of the hockey-stick theorem</h1>

<p>A little while ago, I came across a description of an identity about
elements of Pascal’s triangle. The identity seems to sometimes be called
the “hockey-stick identity”, and sometimes the “Christmas stocking
identity”. It says, roughly speaking, that the sum down a diagonal of
Pascal’s triangle is equal to the entry in the next row and one “across”
diagonally.</p>
<p>To give a concrete example:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>1</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>1</td>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>1</td>
<td></td>
<td>2</td>
<td></td>
<td>1</td>
<td></td>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td></td>
<td>1</td>

<td>3</td>

<td>3</td>

<td>1</td>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>1</td>
<td></td>
<td>4</td>
<td></td>
<td>6</td>
<td></td>
<td>4</td>
<td></td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<script src="highlight-table.js"></script>
<p>Here, the blue diagonal entries, 1, 2, and 3, add up to the yellow
entry, 6.</p>
<p>In general, suppose <em>n</em> and <em>r</em> are integers, with
<em>n</em> ≥ <em>r</em> ≥ 0. Then, using the notation
<em>C</em>(<em>m</em>, <em>k</em>) for binomial coefficients, the
theorem says that</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<p><em>C</em>(<em>r</em>, <em>r</em>) + <em>C</em>(<em>r</em>+1,
<em>r</em>) + <em>C</em>(<em>r</em>+2, <em>r</em>) + ⋯ +
<em>C</em>(<em>n</em>, <em>r</em>) = <em>C</em>(<em>n</em>+1,
<em>r</em>+1).</p>
</div>
<p>This example is</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<p><em>C</em>(1, 1) + <em>C</em>(2, 1) + <em>C</em>(3, 1) =
<em>C</em>(4, 2),</p>
</div>
<p>and for small <em>r</em>, the identity can be loosely paraphrased
as</p>
<ul>
<li>(<em>r</em> = 0) adding up ones gives counting numbers;</li>
<li>(<em>r</em> = 1) adding up counting numbers gives triangular
numbers;</li>
<li>(<em>r</em> = 2) adding up triangular numbers gives pyramid
numbers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey-stick_identity">Wikipedia
page</a> has some proofs.</p>
<p>Knowing that this identity had a name, I was reminded of two examples
I had encountered.</p>
<h2 id="the-twelve-days-of-christmas">The twelve days of Christmas</h2>
<p>The first example is particularly apt given the “Christmas stocking”
name. The task is to count the total number of gifts in the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twelve_Days_of_Christmas_(song)">Twelve
Days of Christmas song</a>.</p>
<p>We can start with looking at the first few days:</p>
<ul>
<li>On day 1, there is <strong>1</strong> gift: 1 (partridge in a pear
tree).</li>
<li>On day 2, there are <strong>3</strong> gifts: 2 (turtle doves) + 1
(partridge).</li>
<li>On day 3, there are <strong>6</strong> gifts: 3 (French hens) + 2
(turtle doves) + 1 (partridge).</li>
</ul>
<p>Generalising this, on day <em>n</em>, the number of presents is the
<i>n</i>th triangular number, which is <em>C</em>(<em>n</em>+1, 2).</p>
<p>To find the total number of presents over the twelve days of the
song, we want the sum of the first twelve triangular numbers:</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<p><em>C</em>(2, 2) + <em>C</em>(3, 2) + <em>C</em>(4, 2) + ⋯ +
<em>C</em>(13, 2).</p>
</div>
<p>By the Christmas stocking identity, this is <em>C</em>(14, 3) = 364,
which we can verify directly.</p>
<h3 id="explicit-bijection">Explicit bijection</h3>
<p>With combinatorial identities like this, it is interesting to see
whether we can find an actual bijection. (<a
href="https://redfrontdoor.org/blog/?p=379">A different example I wrote
about previously is a bijection between expressions for integers as sums
of square and triangular numbers.</a>)</p>
<p>In this case, we want a bijection between these two sets:</p>
<ul>
<li>the set of 364 individual gifts received over the twelve days of
Christmas, and</li>
<li>the set of 364 choices of three things from a collection of
fourteen.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the second set, we can stack fourteen rows in a column, and
imagine choosing three of them. Then a particular individual present can
be identified as follows. The top chosen row determines the day; the
middle chosen row tells us the kind of gift; and the bottom chosen row
tells us the individual instance of that kind of gift on that day.</p>
<p>Below is an interactive illustration which lets you choose three
things from fourteen by moving three sliders up and down. The fourteen
rows are labelled such that the windows in the sliders combine to reveal
each of the 364 individual presents. This does mean that each row of
this table seems to be off by one day, but if you read what’s shown
through the windows, everything works.</p>

<h2 id="juggling-show-pyramid">Juggling show “Pyramid”</h2>
<p>The other example is from a cool juggling show I saw at the 2024
European Juggling Convention. <a
href="https://www.jugglingdom.com/shows/pyramid-show">The show is called
“Pyramid”</a>, and the performer, Domenyk La Terra, did various elegant
and skillful things with different numbers of balls, juggling them and
balancing them on and rolling them along beams. I thought this was a
very good show — worth seeing if you get the chance.</p>
<p>A big theme of the show (as you can guess from its title) is
<em>pyramids</em>, and he works with different sizes of pyramids of
juggling balls:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tiny (1-layer) pyramid: 1 ball = first triangular number = 1 =
<em>C</em>(3, 3).</li>
<li>Small (2-layer) pyramid: 4 balls = sum of first two triangular
numbers = 1 + 3 = <em>C</em>(4, 3).</li>
<li>Medium (3-layer) pyramid: 10 balls = sum of first three triangular
numbers = 1 + 3 + 6 = <em>C</em>(5, 3).</li>
<li>Big (4-layer) pyramid: 20 balls = sum of first four triangular
numbers = 1 + 3 + 6 + 10 = <em>C</em>(6, 3).</li>
</ul>

<img src="four-pyramids.jpg" style="width: 75%; margin-top: 1rem;"
 alt="Performer Domenyk La Terra standing next to four tall plinths, each with a different number of juggling balls arranged in a pyramid on top of it.">

<p>One part (and this is in the trailer, so is no more of a spoiler than
if you watched the video on <a
href="https://www.jugglingdom.com/shows/pyramid-show">the performer’s
site</a>) involves combining these four pyramids of balls into one very
big (5-layer) pyramid consisting of 35 balls.</p>

<p>My immediate thought when I saw this was that it was just a pleasing
cosmic coincidence, but in fact it’s another instance of the
hockey-stick identity, with one small extra step. By the hockey-stick
identity, we can find the sum of the first four pyramid numbers (i.e.,
the total number of balls in the four pyramids) as follows:</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<p><em>C</em>(3, 3) + <em>C</em>(4, 3) + <em>C</em>(5, 3) +
<em>C</em>(6, 3) = <em>C</em>(7, 4) = 35.</p>
</div>
<p>But also, <em>C</em>(7, 4) = <em>C</em>(7, 3), because choosing four
things you want from a tray of seven things is the same as choosing
which three to leave on the tray, and <em>C</em>(7, 3) is the fifth
pyramid number. So the sum of the first four pyramid numbers is the
fifth pyramid number.</p>
<p>This observation will extend so that, for example,</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<p><em>C</em>(4, 4) + <em>C</em>(5, 4) + <em>C</em>(6, 4) +
<em>C</em>(7, 4) + <em>C</em>(8, 4) = <em>C</em>(9, 5) = <em>C</em>(9,
4),</p>
</div>
<p>which is saying that the first five hyper-pyramid numbers (if that is
indeed their name) sum to the sixth:</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<p>1 + 5 + 15 + 35 + 70 = 126.</p>
</div>
<p>Going in the other direction, the sum of the first three triangular
numbers is the fourth triangular number: 1 + 3 + 6 = 10, and the sum of
the first two counting numbers is the third counting number: 1 + 2 = 3.
We could even say that the sum of the first one one is the second one: 1
= 1.</p>
